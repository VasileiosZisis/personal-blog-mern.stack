### A blog website

This app is created with mongoDB, expressjs, react and nodejs. I have disabled the registration
in the live website. Will add the ability for users to create comments, when there will be enough content.

It includes the following:

- GET/POST/PUT/DELETE routes for the blogposts
- RTK query from Redux Toolkit for fetching and handling data
- Admin functionality
- JWT for authentication
- Authorization
- React-hook-form for the forms and JOI for frontend and backend validation
- Swiper for the carousel and react-paginate for the pagination
- React-quill for the text editor with the ability to save the text in localStorage
- Images are saved in Cloudinary
- Some web security stuff
